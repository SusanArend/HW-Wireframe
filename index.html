<!--Hi guys!  Thanks so much for looking over my code.  I'm definitely dissappointed that I didn't feel I could successfully complete the recommended homework on time (that's why I did the "easier" assignment, but I've been super diligent with this one and think it looks fairly identical and utilizes all the required styling and elements.  Hat tip to Ethan for the awesome diagnostic help Tuesday night.  He is a wizard.-->
